# Basic-Portfolio
### Objective: 
Build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS.

### Specifications

The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**. 
   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself.
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   
The content for the `portfolio.html` should show your past projects. 
   * List out all past projects with the placehold images along with the project title
   * Allow the user to click on each project as a link to view.   

After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.
